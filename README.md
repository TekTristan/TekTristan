Hi there! My name is Tristan Dinh and I am a passionate computer science student at Sacramento State, where I am currently working towards my B.S. degree. I have previously worked as a Student Assistant Web Developer, and am eager to continue my professional growth as a Full-Stack Developer. With a strong foundation in computer science principles and a desire to constantly learn and stay up-to-date with new technologies, I believe I have the skills and drive to make a positive impact in any development team.
